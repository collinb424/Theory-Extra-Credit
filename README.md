# Theory-Extra-Credit
1. **What was the extra work:** I spoke to Professor Kogge around Thanksgiving break regarding doing an extra credit assignment related to Context Free Grammars and the Chomsky hierarchy.
   One of the ideas he suggested was to do research on Chomsky’s views on linguistics and write about them. I was quickly led down a variety of paths in linguistics, philosophy, artificial intelligence,
   mathematics, and theory of computing. My essay begins by describing some important linguistic developments prior to Chomsky, then summarizes Chomsky’s contributions, and finally relates them
   to modern developments in artificial intelligence.
2. **Why did you choose it:** I felt drawn to study Context Free Grammars and the Chomsky Hierarchy because I struggled with some of these problems on Exam 2, and because I see them as topics useful for synthesizing the entire course.
   The Chomsky hierarchy includes Turing Machines all the way down to DFAs, so I wanted to get more background on how these topics relate to other areas, like linguistics and artificial intelligence. I was surprised to find how intimately
   connected all of these various areas are. I probably spent over 10 hours doing research on this, but I found it to be absolutely fascinating and a great way to sum up this semester. I hope to into much more depth on these topics in the future.
3. **What files are what:** The file "Theory Extra Credit Collin Bowers.pdf" is my extra credit submission.
